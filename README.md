# About This Project

This is a simple message editor for Sonic Heroes, allowing you to edit the messages shown by various triggers such as hint boxes or invisible talk triggers.

## Features

#### Realtime Filtering

Finding some text among 1000+ hints can be quite difficult.
This editor has a filter, allowing you to only show hints matching a specific text.

#### Support for ANSI Languages

This editor supports editing of English, French, German, Italian and Spanish language text.

#### Easy To Use

Open a binary file e.g. `hint001e.bin`, edit the entries and save. It's that easy.

## Help Needed
Parsing Japanese and Korean texts, which are split between metrics (.txt) and the binary files.
